First do this let do a test run of the installation process:

```bash
# create your test directories
mkdir -p ~/tmp/test/.config

# simulate stow package creation of using ~/.dotfiles
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-X
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-i3
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-vim
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-tmux
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-bash
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-conky
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-screen
stow --simulate --verbose=5 --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/.config --stow pkg-nvim

# stow nvim package - aka create your symlinks for your nvim configuration files
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-X
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-i3
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-vim
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-tmux
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-bash
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-conky
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --stow pkg-screen
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/.config --stow pkg-nvim

# inspect what you have just created
ls -al ~/tmp/test
ls -al ~/tmp/test/.config

# undo / remove your stow creation
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/ --delete pkg-X
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/ --delete pkg-i3
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test --delete pkg-vim
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/ --delete pkg-tmux
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/ --delete pkg-bash
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/ --delete pkg-conky
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/ --delete pkg-screen
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME/tmp/test/.config --delete pkg-nvim
```




Now let us do it for real:

```bash
# put into you '.bashrc' file the environment variable for the path to 'tmux.conf' file
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.config

# stow nvim package - aka create your symlinks for your nvim configuration files
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-X                 # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-i3                # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-vim               # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-tmux              # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-bash              # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-conky             # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --stow pkg-screen            # DONE
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME --stow pkg-nvim   # DONE

# and if you wish to undo this for any reason ....
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-X
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-i3
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-vim
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-tmux
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-bash
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-conky
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$HOME --delete pkg-screen
stow --dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --target=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME --delete pkg-nvim
```










# Dotfiles Directory: /home/jeff/.dotfiles
Like many, I have multiple Linux machines that I have setup to rule my computational life style.
Also like many, I want to avoid surprises in my computational life.
I want to move freely among my systems and have at my finger tips all the same
tools and resources that I have grown accustom too.
This requires strict consistence for the user experience,
despite the differences in the environments the tools are location.
Given that in the Linux world, tool behavior is often dictated by [dotfiles][01],
it is these dotfile that must be consistent on each system.
This [Dotfiles Directory][01] is a key player to making things easier for me.

To find out more about creating and managing your `.dotfiles`,
check out the documentation and videos below:

# Installation of Dotfiles & Required Tools
The contents of the `http://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.dotfiles.git`
[Git][05] repository includes all the instructions and tools
required for testing and installation of my `.dotfiles`.
You can quickly clone the Git repository on the target machine,
run some simple scripts, re-login or reboot, and get yourself underway.
This simple and quick procedure will be document here.

If your unfamiliar with `.dotfiles` and how the tools used here operate,
it could be wiser for you to jump to the "Dry-Run Testing" section
and follow those procedure first.
This will give you a safe way to try thing out before you commit to
a complete installation on your target machine.

#### Step X: Creating Your Local Git Repository
Clone the `.dotfiles` Git Repository within your `$HOME` directory.

```bash
# clone .dotfiles directory
cd $HOME
git clone http://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.dotfiles.git
```

#### Step X: Install Stow
Very first step is to install Stow on your machine:

```bash
# install stow
sudo apt install stow
```



-----



# Dry-Run Testing
Prior to doing a full install of the `.dotfiles`,
you may want to perform some testing in a safe place.
You have two options:

* **Use a Virtual Machine -**
The first is test outside your target machine,
and perform the installation on a virtual machine.
This will completely protest you from anything going badly.
* **Use a Temporary Directory -**
The second option is to use your target machine,
but instead of installing on you home directory,
make the target a safe place like `/tmp` or a custom directory of your choose.

There are procedure listed below for both these options.

## Dry-Run Testing Use a Virtual Machine
For this type of testing,
I'll make use of [Vagrant][03] and [Ansible][04] as tools to quickly
and reliable set up testing environments.
Within the `~/.dotfiles/test` directory are references to a VagrantFile and Ansible Playbook.
Vagrant will be used to spin-up some virtual machines (VM) via the `~/.dotfiles/test/VagrantFile`
and then VMs will provisioned via the  `~/.dotfiles/test/playbooks/playbook.yml`

There are the following phases to standing-up the Dry-Run Testing:

* Prepare Your Tools
* Prepare Virtual Machines
* Prepare Virtual Machines for Provisioning
* Provision Virtual Machines

### Prepare Your Tools

#### Step X: Install Vagrant
To create the virtual machine where testing will be perfromed,
I make use of [Vagrant][03].
See `~/.dotfiles/docs/using-vagrant-docker-and-ansible.md` to understand how to do this.

#### Step X: Install Ansible
[Ansible][04] will be used to build the VM test envirment once Vagrant has established those VMs.
The Ansible host computers could exist anywhere, including on the target machine,
as long as all are reachable via SSH.
On your Ansible host machine,
your first step is to install Ansible and any extension you may want to use.
See `~/.dotfiles/docs/using-vagrant-docker-and-ansible.md` to understand how to do this.

### Prepare Virtual Machines

#### Step X: Create VM Testing Environment
Assuming Vagrant is installed and properly configured,
the `VagrantFile` and Ansible's `playbook.yml` is ready to establish the testing VMs.

```bash
# spin-up the virtual machines
cd ~/.dotfiles/test
vagrant up
```

### Prepare Virtual Machines for Provisioning

#### Step X: Installing Ansible on Ansible Server
The Ansible host computers could exist anywhere as long as they are reachable via SSH.
On your Ansible host machine,
your first step is to install Ansible and any extension you may want to use.
See `~/.dotfiles/docs/using-vagrant-docker-and-ansible.md` to understand how to do this.

#### Step X: Copy SSH Keys to Client
Ansible primarily communicates with client computers through SSH.
While it has the ability to handle password-based SSH authentication,
using SSH keys can help to keep things simple.
(Check [here][06] if you need more information concerning SSH,
how to generate keys, using keys, etc.)

On my Ansible server, I have created a specific SSH key for Ansible work.
That key is `~/.ssh/ansible.pub`.

##### Method A: Copying Public Key Using `ssh-copy-id`
The simplest method to provide the SSH keys to the client computer
is to use the `ssh-copy-id` tool.
Launching from the Ansible server, the syntax is:
`ssh-copy-id username@remote_host`.
In my case:

```bash
# from my desktop computer, copying public key using ssh-copy-id
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible.pub pi@home-assist

# or
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible.pub pi@192.168.1.203
```

To test if this is successful,
login to your Ansible client via SSH: `pi@192.168.1.203`
and you should get in without being prompted for a password.

##### Method B: Copying Public Key Using SSH
If you do not have `ssh-copy-id` available on your computer,
but you have password-based SSH access to an account on your server,
you can upload your keys using a conventional SSH method:

```bash
# from my desktop computer, copying public key using ssh
cat ~/.ssh/ansible.pub | ssh pi@home-assist "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod -R go= ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

##### Method C: Copying Public Key Manually
The final method is just to do it all manually.
Assuming SSH is already established on your Ansible server,
use the `cat` command to print the contents of your
non-root userâ€™s SSH public key file to the terminalâ€™s output:

```bash
# copy this public ssh key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the resulting output to your clipboard,
then open a new terminal and connect to one of your Ansible hosts using SSH,
and do the following:

1. Switch to the client machineâ€™s root user.
1. As the root user, open the `authorized_keys` within the `~/.ssh` directory:
1. In the file, paste your Ansible server userâ€™s SSH key, then save the file.

#### Step X: Creating Hosts File
Ansible needs to know your remote server names or IP address.
This information is stored in a file called `hosts`, or often refered to as your "inventory".
The default file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`.
You can edit this one or create a new one in your `$HOME` directory,
or better yet, place the `hosts` file in your projects directory referance it
on the command-line when running `ansible`.

```bash
# create the hosts (aka inventory) file for your raspberry pi
cat <<EOF > inventory
# Maintainer:   jeffskinnerbox@yahoo.com / www.jeffskinnerbox.me
# Version:      0.0.1

# aka ansible hosts file

# ansible control node
#[controller]
#127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

# ansible managed hosts (aka nodes)
[nodes]
home-assist ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.203 ansible_ssh_port=22 kubernetes_role=node
#node-1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.231 ansible_ssh_port=22 kubernetes_role=master
#node-2 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.232 ansible_ssh_port=22 kubernetes_role=node
#node-3 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.233 ansible_ssh_port=22 kubernetes_role=node

# ansible varables applied to [nodes]
[nodes:vars]
ansible_user='pi'
ansible_ssh_user=pi
deploy_target=pi
ansible_become=yes
ansible_become_method=sudo
ansible_python_interpreter='/usr/bin/env python3'
#ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
EOF
```

### Provision Virtual Machines

#### Step X: Run Ansible Playbook
```bash
# provision the software to create the testing envirnment
ansible-playbook -i inventory -l nvimtest ~/.dotfiles/test/playbooks/playbook.yml --tags install
```
