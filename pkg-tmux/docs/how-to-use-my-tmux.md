# Copy & Paste
I can do copy & paste with the following keys and mouse movements:

* **Copy & Paste Within Tmux**
    * **Copy Text -** Using the mouse, put cursor at beginning of text, hold down left-button,
    move over the text to be copied, and release button when done.
    This copies the text into the system clipboard.
    * **Paste Text -** Place cursor at the beginning of the point of insertion,
    and then press/release the center mouse button, aka the wheel.
