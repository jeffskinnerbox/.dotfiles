# If you install fzf, ripgrep, and bat, you can use the following awesome command to
# fuzzy search your file system and open the matched lines in your favorite text editor.
# This scrip opens files in $EDITOR or defaults to nano.  You can change the editor if you wish.
#
# To use the script, simply change to a directory that contains text files and the letter "s."
# While this command will accept plain old words for search terms,
# you can dramatically boost its accuracy by using Regex.
