# Pre-configured Distro or Manual?
Months ago I asked my self,
should I setup my own NeoVim configuration or use one of the preconfigured NeoVim distributions?
Here are two opinions, and I choose to follow #2:

1. [Beginners should use a preconfigured Neovim distribution](https://dev.to/ratiu5/beginners-should-use-a-preconfigured-neovim-distribution-253p)
2. [You Should Use A Neovim Distro If You Are New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qSzFWRz6Ck)

[My coding-life style spans][AA] `ed` to `vi` to `vim`, and in all cases,
I built my own configuration file.
Yes, I did significant copy & paste from online sources but
it was my own creation and I was very pleased with what I created.
When it was time for me to move to `nvim`,
I didn't even consider using a pre-configured NeoVim distribution.
In fact, at the time, I didn't know they even existed.
I plunged head first into the NeoVim world.

When I started, I had very limited knowledge of Lua, Vim/NeoVim plugins,
and a lack of detail documentation on how to assemble a configuration file.
This lack of knowledge did stop me in the past and I saw no reason why it should this time.
I initiated my journey, much like I have in the past, by building the configuration file in increments.
Each increment built on it predecessor, each having a more useful functionality, and each gaining increasing scope & complexity.
**What a slog it was**!

About halfway to my goal, and after some quick successes (I had a working `nvim` editor and I abandoned `vim`),
I bogged down into a state of not really knowing how NeoVim + Lua + Plugins worked.
Sure, I had some good things working but I could not get ride of some persistent bug
and it was not clear to me how I should be layering on additional functionality.

I resorted to firing up some pre-configured NeoVim distributions (NvChad and LazyVim)
and following their documentation in the hopes of find the secret sauce to my problem.
This only caused me more pain, suffering, and moments of despair.

Then one glorious day, I stumble upon the Youtube series
["Understanding Neovim"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx2ksyallYzW4WNYHD9xOFrPRYGlntAft).
This gave me the bits of insights that I needed.
The video series is excellent and the author has real insight into what was challenging me.
This video series should be helpful to NeoVim beginner
and experienced user alike (I'm personally exhibit A).

Another very helpful gem is the post ["Switching Configs in Neovim"](https://michaeluloth.com/neovim-switch-configs/).
To incrementally build the NeoVim editor, your going to want to concurrently use `nvim`
(what better way to test a text editor than to use it every day)
and concurrently build a significantly enhanced version of itself.
Two instances of NeoVim, each with its own radically different configuration,
running on the same box.
This is a challenge and this post show you how to do it.



# Helix and Others
I became aware of [Helix](https://dev.to/thedenisnikulin/my-approach-to-neovim-3625)
while read the post ["My approach to Neovim"](https://dev.to/thedenisnikulin/my-approach-to-neovim-3625).
This post also references [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim),
which I embraced earlier, but the posting help confirm to me it was good approach for me.



# Kick-Start NeoVim
This is a starting point for Neovim.
It is meant to be used as by YOU to begin your Neovim journey;
remove the things you don't use and add what you miss.

# Project Structure
If you want to load Lua files on demand, you can place them in the `lua`
directory in your [`runtimepath`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath')
default is `~/.config/nvim/lua`)
and load them with a `require` statement.

This is where your nvim configuration lives:
namespace

```
Using command: tree -a --filesfirst ~/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim

~/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/
â”œâ”€â”€ init.lua                              <-- entry point for `nvim` to access your configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ lua                                   <-- the directory where all of your lua code and plugin config goes (i.e. in your runtime path)
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ active                            <-- my namespace directory to avoid collisions with other plugins and lua modules, (i.e. currently 'active' nvim configuration)

â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ lsp                       <-- lsp is complicated enough to warrant itâ€™s own separate directory
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ settings              <-- specific settings for your Language Server
â”‚   â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ pyright.lua
â”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ sumneko_lua.lua
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ <other namespaces>                <-- other instances of nvim using other plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ plugin                                <-- plugin folder & its files are the output of Packer plugin manager
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ packer_compiled.lua
â”œâ”€â”€ swap
â””â”€â”€ undo
```

The configuration structure is relatively simple:

* `init.lua`: the entry point for `nvim` to access your configuration files
* `lua/`: the directory where all the `nvim` lua code and plugin config goes
* `lua/active`: a namespace to avoid collisions with other plugins and lua modules
* `lua/active/core`:
* `lua/active/configs`:
* `lua/active/lsp`: lsp is complicated enough to warrant itâ€™s own separate directory
* `lua/active/lsp/settings`: specific settings for your Language Server, to find more settings for your language server read more [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md)

You will find plugins here under `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer`.
You will also find other useful plugin data

cache: `~/.cache` You can find logs here

state: `~/.local/state` You can find state about Neovim as well as other plugins here

Use the following to execute Neovim: `alias vi="gnome-terminal --title NeoVim -- nvim -p"`
Use the following to cleanout Neovim:
`trash ~/.cache/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.config/nvim/undo \
      ~/.config/nvim/site ~/.config/nvim/swap ~/.config/nvim/plugin ~/.config/nvim/share`

* `~/.config/nvim`: This is where your config lives
* `~/.local/share`: You will find plugins here under: `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer`.
You will also find other useful plugin data.
* `~/.cache`: You can find logs here
* `~/.local/state`: You can find state about Neovim as well as other plugins here.

* **LSP** stands for Language Server Protocol, and it provides:
    * Completions
    * Diagnostics
    * (GOTO Definition, Find References etc..)
    * Code actions
    * Autoimport
    * Sometimes formatters
* **Formatters** help keep a consistent style across your codebase (ex. prettier, black, stylua)
* **Linters** add extra diagnostics in addition to your language server,
often they will provide stylistic suggestions (ex. eslint, flake8, shellcheck):
* **Treesitter** at basic level provides syntax highlighting and indentation,
but also provides much more when combined with other features
