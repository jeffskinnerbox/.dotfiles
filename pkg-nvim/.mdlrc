-- Markdownlint `.mdlrc` file
-- BUG: DOES NOT WORK - This file isn't being picked up by NeoVim's linting process

-- Markdownlint tries to load configuration from `.mdlrc` file in the current directory.
-- If not found, it will look for it in the parent directory and so on,
-- going up until it reaches file home directory. - https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/main/docs/configuration.md
