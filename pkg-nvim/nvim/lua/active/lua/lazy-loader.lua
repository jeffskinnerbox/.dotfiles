--[[ modern plugin manager for Neovim with a powerful UI and a fast startup time

  Description:
    A plugin package manager helps with the installation and overall care of plugins.
    You options for NeoVim plugin management include Vim-Plug, Packer.nvim, and Lazy.nvim.
    To put it simply, Lazy.nvim is a far superior to the others. Checkout
    the videos below to find out why.

      What is Lazyloading? - This is when the loading of a plugin is delayed until a specific event ocures within a plugin or NeoVim.
      What is a Protected Call? - Making a Lua function call just to test for the proper operation of the function.
      What is an Auto Command? - A hunk of code that gets executed when a Vim event happens.
      What is Asynchronous Linting Engine? - This is a linting engine which will only start for a specific file type.

    Plugins can be loaded using a modular approach: using `require 'path/name'` will
    include a plugin definition from file `lua/path/name.lua.

    Plugins can also be added by using a table, with the first argument being
    the link and the following keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
    e.g. `{ 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} }`. You can use `opts = {}` to
    force a plugin to be loaded. This is equivalent to: `require('Comment').setup({})`.

  Usage:
    list the most significant commandline and keymap operations

    Commandline
      :Lazy show (or just :Lazy)    - show the Lazy mgmt / status window
      :Lazy health                  - runs 'healthcheck' just for Lazy and identifies any configuration issues
      :checkhealth lazy             - runs 'healthcheck' just for Lazy and identifies any configuration issues

    Plugin History
      :Lazy log <plugin-name>       - show the previous github commits, to revert the plugin to any of those commits all I have to do is place the cursor above the commit hash and press 'r'
      :Lazy restore <plugin-name>   - this will revert the plugin <plugin-name> to the state reflected in the 'lazy-lock.json' lockfile
      :Lazy restore                 - this will revert all the plugins to the state reflected in the 'lazy-lock.json' lockfile

    Within Lazy Popup Status Window
      <shift>+I                     - install any missing plugins
      <shift>+S                     - sync is equivalent to running 'install' + 'clean' + 'update'
      <shift>+U                     - update plugins, this will also update the 'lazy-lock.json' lockfile
      <shift>+X                     - clear out plugins that are no longer needed
      <shift>+C                     - check for GitHub updates and show the log (aka 'git fetch')
      <shift>+L                     - show the git change log for the most recent updates
      <shift>+R                     - updates all plugins to the state in the 'lazy-lock.json' lockfile, for a single plugin restore it to the state in the lockfile or to a given commit under the cursor
      <shift>+P                     - show the plugin loading timeperfromance profile
      <shift>+D                     - show debug information for when things go wrong
      <shift>+?                     - help information when things go wrong

    Keymapped Commands
      None that I'm using or aware of.
