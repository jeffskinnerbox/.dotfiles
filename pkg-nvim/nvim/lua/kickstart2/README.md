* Treesitter
What is a Parser? -- A parser converts unstructured data from one format to another. It is generally done to make the existing, unreadable data more comprehensible.
What Is Grammar? -- Grammar is defggined as a system of language rules that allows you to combine individual words to make complex meanings. Grammar rules concern the use of clauses, phrases, and words. 
What is Syntax? -- Syntax is the study of how linguistic elements (such as words) are put together to form constituents (such as phrases or clauses) to create a connected, orderly system.
What is Semantics? -- Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning of a word, phrase, sentence, or text. It examines what meaning is, how words get their meaning, and how the meaning of a complex expression depends on its parts. 
What's the Difference Between Syntax and Grammar? -- Syntax is a subdivision of grammar. Grammar comprises the entire system of rules for a language, including syntax. Syntax deals with the way that words are put together to form phrases, clauses, and sentences.
What's the Differnace Betwwen Sytax and Sggemantics? -- Syntax is the structure of language. Elements of syntax include word order and sentence structure, which can help reveal the function of an unknown word. Semantics is the meaning of individual words. If one word is unknown, the meanings of surrounding words can give clues to the word's probable meaning.
What is a Syntax Error? -- Syntax errors are mistakes in using the language. Examples of syntax errors are missing a comma or a quotation mark, or misspelling a word.
What is a Syntax Tree? -- A syntax tree is a visual representation of a source code's syntactic structure, or grammatical hierarchy. It's often used in compiler design to make the code structure easier to analyze and manipulate.  A syntax tree is created by the compiler based on the parse tree after the parser has finished processing the source code. 

It looks at one file at a time and provides information about the text.
Treesitter and LSP are unrelated.
1. LSP is looking at your code at the semantic level. It looks at you whole project, all the files, to extract meaning. It then provides definitiaions, completions that are accurate.
2. Treesitter is a praser generator tool to understand a single files grammar. It know nothing about the language at a semantic level, it only know about the text.
Treesiter isn't an interpreter, its just a library for interacting with text.

What is Treesiter then ...
1. It is a parser generator tool. This parser is then loaded into what ever application that could benefit from it
2. The parser automatically get an increment error recovering for the grammar.  You don't have to provide this adaptive recovery process.
3. Query engine for the syntax tree allowing you to ask questions about that syntax tree.  Treesitter just cares about text and helps use ask questions about that text.

So what is this all good for?  It allows you to actively edit your file and Treesitter will provide near real-time feedback about errors in what your writing (grammar erros, highlighting, indenting, folding)
and do things structural editing (edit parathses in one operation).

## Add kickstart.nvim to .dotfiles
I followed the procedures outlined in the [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim README.md file][01]
by first forking the Git repository to `$HOME/src` and then cloning that repository into this location.

```bash
# goto the https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/master
# OR https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/kickstart-modular.nvim
# https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim/tree/master
# and fork the repository via the button on top right

# your forked version of kickstart.nvim is now located here:
# https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/kickstart.nvim
# forked on June 25, 2024

# move to target directory for the clone and do the clone
# cloned on June 25, 2024
cd $HOME/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/lua
git clone https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/kickstart-modular.nvim.git kickstart
```

## Install Prerequisties
I install the Linux prerequisites for a robust NeoVim installation.
See `$HOME/pkg-nvim/docs/setting-up-neovim.md`.

Basic utils: git, make, unzip, C Compiler (gcc)
ripgrep
Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on platform)
A Nerd Font: optional, provides various icons
if you have it set vim.g.have_nerd_font in init.lua to true
Language Setup:
If want to write Typescript, you need npm
If want to write Golang, you will need go
etc.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make gcc ripgrep unzip git xclip neovim
```

## Make It Yours
I want to update Kickstart in a minimal way so I can use it with easy but maintain the ordinal functionality.
I will then make updates to this ordinal Kickstart configuration to make it suit my needs.

#### Step 1 - DONE
Make a copy of the ordinal Kickstart configuration (`kickstart` directory).
I did this with the following: `cd $HOME/dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/lua/kickstart ; cp -r kickstart kickstart2`

From here onward, we should work exclusively in the `kickstart2` directory.

#### Step 2 - DONE
* In the `init.lua` file,
the custom option `vim.g.have_nerd_font` is set to `false`
but should be set to `true` (e.g. `vim.g.have_nerd_font = true`)
since I'm using Nerd Fonts.

This option is used the files `lua/lazy-plugins.lua`, `lua/kickstart/plugins/telescope.lua`,
and `lua/kickstart/plugins/mini.lua`
for adding icons and loading the `nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons` plugin.

#### Step 3 - DONE
Set the leader keys options in the `init.lua` file to
`vim.g.mapleader = ','` and `vim.g.maplocalleader = ','`.

#### Step 4
An alternative to the `netrw` filesystem navegator is offered by Kickstart,
just un-comment `require 'kickstart.plugins.neo-tree'`
in file `kickstart2/lua/kickstart/lazy-plugins.lua`.
I'm not a fan of this navigator and I prefer `nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua`.

To install my prefered filesystem navigation, I must make updates to
`kickstart2/lua/kickstart/lazy-plugins.lua`, `kickstart2/lua/custom/plugins/init.lua`,
`kickstart2/lua/custom/plugins`, `kickstart2/lua/init.lua`:

* In `kickstart2/lua/kickstart/lazy-plugins.lua`, un-comment the line containing `{ import = 'custom.plugins' }`. - DONE
* In `kickstart2/lua/custom/plugins/init.lua`, enter your plugin's GitHub identifier so it can be Lazy loaded. - DONE
* In `kickstart2/lua/custom/plugins` include a file named `nvim-tree.lua` containing the `setup()` for your plugin.
* In `kickstart2/lua/init.lua` file disable NeoVim's native filesystem navicator `netrw` by add `vim.g.loaded_netrw = 1`
and `vim.g.loaded_netrwPlugin = 1` to top of the `kickstart2/lua/init.lua` file.

#### Step 6
#### Step 7

# kickstart-modular.nvim

## Introduction

*This is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that moves from a single file to a multi file configuration.*

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Modular
* Completely Documented

**NOT** a Neovim distribution, but instead a starting point for your configuration.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

Kickstart.nvim targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Language Setup:
  - If want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

> **NOTE**
> See [Install Recipes](#Install-Recipes) for additional Windows and Linux specific notes
> and quick install snippets

### Install Kickstart

> **NOTE**
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)| `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\` |
| Windows (powershell)| `$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\nvim\` |

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> **NOTE**
> Your fork's url will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart-modular.nvim.git`

#### Clone kickstart.nvim
> **NOTE**
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `dam9000` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

If you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim.git %userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim\
```

If you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim.git $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\nvim\
```

</details>

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

Read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring Neovim. That also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.


### Getting Started

[The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim](https://youtu.be/m8C0Cq9Uv9o)

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing neovim configuration?
    * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
    * This includes your existing init.lua and the neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
    * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
    * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-uninstalling) information
* Why is the kickstart `init.lua` a single file? Wouldn't it make sense to split it into multiple files?
    * The main purpose of kickstart is to serve as a teaching tool and a reference
    configuration that someone can easily use to `git clone` as a basis for their own.
    As you progress in learning Neovim and Lua, you might consider splitting `init.lua`
    into smaller parts. A fork of kickstart that does this while maintaining the
    same functionality is available here:
    * [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)
    * *NOTE: This is the fork that splits the configuration into smaller parts.*
    The original repo with the single `init.lua` file is available here:
    * [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
    * Discussions on this topic can be found here:
    * [Restructure the configuration](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/issues/218)
    * [Reorganize init.lua into a multi-file setup](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/pull/473)

### Install Recipes

Below you can find OS specific install instructions for Neovim and dependencies.

After installing all the dependencies continue with the [Install Kickstart](#Install-Kickstart) step.

#### Windows Installation

<details><summary>Windows with Microsoft C++ Build Tools and CMake</summary>
Installation may require installing build tools and updating the run command for `telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

- Install CMake and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
</details>
<details><summary>Windows with gcc/make using chocolatey</summary>
Alternatively, one can install gcc and make which don't require changing the config,
the easiest way is to use choco:

1. install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
either follow the instructions on the page or use winget,
run in cmd as **admin**:
```
winget install --accept-source-agreements chocolatey.chocolatey
```

2. install all requirements using choco, exit previous cmd and
open a new one so that choco path is set, and run in cmd as **admin**:
```
choco install -y neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make
```
