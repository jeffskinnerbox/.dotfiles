--[[ nvim-lspconfig is a collection of configurations for various language servers
kickstart2/lua/kickstart/plugins/nvim-lspconfig.lua

  Description:
    This plugin sets the configuration needed for interacting with LSP servers
    and configuration for the Neovim LSP client.

    LSP stands for Language Server Protocol, which is meant to standardize the
    format or protocol for how language servers and clients communicate.
    A LSP enables code analysis, autocomplete, linting, and other features
    through language-specific servers.

    It communicates with all the LSP servers to get all the modern
    IDE features like code completion, error & warning markings, highlighting,
    and auto refactoring & formatting. It is also ere where different
    programming languages are turned on/off.

    1. Sensible defaults for various LSP
    2. Launch LSP automatically for corresponding filetypes
    If you only use a few language servers and have enough free time you can do the above by yourself.

  Definitions:
    What is LSP? LSP stands for Language Server Protocol (LSP). It's a protocol that
    helps editors and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
    In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
    language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
    (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
    processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!

    LSP provides Neovim with features like: Go to definition Find references,
    Autocompletion, Symbol Search, and more! Thus, Language Servers are
    external tools that must be installed separately from Neovim. This is where
    `mason` and related plugins come into play.

    If you're wondering about LSP vs Treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
    and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

  Usage:
    list of the most significant commandline and keymap operations

    Commandline
      :help lspconfig-all                 - LSP configs provided by nvim-lspconfig are listed
      :LspInfo                            - status information about your LSP setup
      :Mason                              - List what LSP servers, DAP, Linter, Formatter servers are install and available, search for what you need and press the 'i' key to install the server, if you no longer need a server use the 'X' key
      :MasonInstall lua-language-server   - install server for specific language, in this case the Lua language

    Keymapped Commands
      None that I'm using or aware of.
