install the appropriate clipboard:

```bash
# if your using X Window's X11 protocol
sudo apt install xsel

nstall # if your using X Window's Wayland protocol
sudo apt install wl-clipboard
```

To fix complaints about lack of Python, Node.js, `ripgrep`, etc. support,
do the following installs on the machine hosting your NeoVim:

```bash
# install git (used by the package installers packer.lua and lazy.lua)
sudo apt install git

# install python support of neovim
pip install pynvim

# install node.js, node package manager (npm), and node support of neovim
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g neovim

# install ruby and ruby support of neovim
sudo apt install ruby
gem install neovim

# ripgrep (executable is called `rg`) is need by for telescope
sudo apt install ripgrep

# install the alternative to 'find' is need by for telescope
sudo apt install fd-find

# install go language support (needed by mason)
sudo apt install golang
```

```bash
# use the following to cleanout old nvim files
trash ~/.cache/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.config/nvim/undo ~/.config/nvim/site ~/.config/nvim/swap ~/.config/nvim/plugin ~/.config/nvim/share
```

## Install the NvChad Framework
```bash
# make your target directory and clone nvchad configuration files
mkdir $HOME/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/lua/nvchad/
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter $HOME/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/lua/nvchad/
#git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/tmp/nvchad-test

# update the `init.lua` file to point to nvchad
vi $HOME/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/init.lua

# delete the `.git` folder from nvchad's `nvim` folder
rm $HOME/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/lua/nvchad/.git
```

Now execute `nvim`, and run within NeoVim `:MasonInstallAll` command
after `lazy.nvim` plugin finishes downloading plugins.

## Update NvCad Plugins
To update all the plugins within NVChad, do the following:
run within NeoVim `:Lazy sync` command.

## Uninstall NvChad Framework
```bash
# use the following to cleanout old nvchad files
trash ~/.cache/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.config/nvim/undo ~/.config/nvim/site ~/.config/nvim/swap ~/.config/nvim/plugin ~/.config/nvim/share

# delete the nvchad folder
rm -r -f $HOME/.dotfiles/pkg-nvim/nvim/lua/nvchad
```
